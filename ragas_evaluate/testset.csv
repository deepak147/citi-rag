If U.S. tax certification is not provided, the account will be subject to backup withholding. An account must not be subject to backup withholding to be eligible to participate in most account promotions; please refer to the separate promotion terms and conditions, if applicable.\nU.S. persons are required to furnish or have a valid Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification \nNumber and Certification) on file with Citibank. Foreign individuals are required to furnish or have a valid Form W-8BEN (Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals) on file with Citibank, and foreign entities are required to furnish or have a valid Form W-8BEN-E (Certificate of Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Entities) on file with Citibank.\nCitibank will apply backup withholding to income payments (e.g., interest) if you: (a) fail to provide a \ncorrect Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), or (b) the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notifies us that you furnished an incorrect TIN, or (c) you or we are notified by the IRS that you are subject to backup withholding. Additionally, the IRS may charge you a $50 penalty for failing to provide Citibank with your correct Name/TIN combination. In some cases, a state and local tax authority may also require that we apply state and local backup withholding on income paid to your account when we are required to apply Federal backup withholding.\nInterest received by U.S Persons will be reported on IRS Form 1099-INT for the year received, as required by \napplicable law. Interest paid to non-U.S. Persons will be reported on IRS Form 1042-S for the year received. If 1099 reporting is required, Citibank will issue a 1099 to the first titled owner on the account. For jointly owned accounts that include both a U.S. owner and a foreign owner, we will issue the 1099 to the U.S. owner.\nPlease review the separate IRA and other tax-qualified retirement account disclosures for additional \nrequirements that may apply.\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act\nIn order for Citibank to be compliant with the provisions of The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (commonly known as “FATCA”), a U.S. federal tax law, Citibank may contact you to request additional information and/or documentation. Please understand that Citibank does not and will not in any way support any attempt by you to evade U.S. taxes or any request by you for help in avoiding detection under FATCA. Furthermore, since Citibank is not in the business of providing tax advice, you should not rely upon Citibank to determine the impact of FATCA on your own business activities or what your own compliance obligations are under FATCA. We encourage you to seek the advice of experienced tax advisors to determine what actions you need to take to become FATCA compliant. Your failure to comply with FATCA may result in restricted access or withholding of taxes from interest payments due to you.\nFootnotes:\n3 IRS Circular 230 Disclosure: Citibank, N.A. its affiliates, and its employees are not in the business of \nproviding tax or legal advice to any taxpayer outside of Citibank, N.A. and its affiliates.

2,What are the conditions under which Citibank may refuse to process a funds transfer request?,"['Currency of Transfer\nFunds Transfers to beneficiaries within the United States are made only in U.S. dollars. For international transfers, Citibank may ask you to indicate the currency in which the beneficiary account is held. If you indicate that the account is held in U.S. dollars, your transfer must be made in U.S. dollars. If you indicate that the account is held in foreign currency (either the local currency of the country where the account is maintained or another foreign currency offered by Citibank) Citibank will send the transfer in that foreign currency unless the transfer in foreign currency is prohibited by local restrictions of the destination country. If you indicate you do not know the currency in which the beneficiary account is held, you can choose to send the transfer in U.S. dollars or in one of the foreign currency options provided by Citibank at the time of the transfer request. You understand that Citibank has the right to rely on your statement as to the currency of the beneficiary account and that it will not be responsible for any error in the information it provides you concerning the applicable exchange rate and the amount of funds to be received by the beneficiary should your statement be incorrect and a currency conversion occurs after Citibank sends your transfer. For transfers in foreign currency, Citibank will convert your U.S. dollar payment to the foreign currency selected by you at Citibank’s exchange rate in effect at that time for similar transactions. The exchange rate includes a commission to Citibank for exchanging the currency. Information regarding the applicable exchange rate will be provided to you at the time you initiate the transfer request. In addition, in the case of transfers into your account which are sent in foreign currencies, we will convert the funds into U.S dollars at our current conversion rate. Our conversion rate for both outgoing and incoming foreign fund transfers includes a commission for the conversion service.\nDelays or Non-Execution of Funds Transfers\nWe will not be liable for any delay or failure to execute your funds transfer request or delay in making the funds available to the beneficiary due to circumstances beyond the control of Citibank or any intermediary or beneficiary bank handling the transfer including, without limitation, any inaccuracy, interruption, delay in transmission, or failure in the means of transmission of your funds transfer request or execution of such request by the bank, whether caused by strikes, power failures, equipment malfunctions, or delays caused by one or more of the institution’s fraud screening procedures or compliance procedures for anti-money laundering, economic sanctions or similar laws.

Interest is computed using a 365-day year, except in leap years when interest may be computed on a 366-day basis. \nInterest Adjustments \nAn interest adjustment for a transaction occurring during a statement period may be reflected on your statement in the next statement period rather than in the statement period in which it occurs.\nLinking \nThe balances in other Citibank accounts that are linked to the Citibank® Savings Plus account will not be included in the daily balance calculation for the Citibank® Savings Plus account. The balance in the Citibank® Savings Plus account may be linked to contribute to the minimum combined average monthly balance requirements of eligible Citibank account packages.\nInterest on Closed Accounts \nIf the account is closed before the end of the monthly statement period, interest will be paid for the number of days the account was open during the period in accordance with daily balance method.\nHousehold Linking of Account Packages \nThis section explains certain features of linking account packages within a household. When you linked together eligible account packages of two or more members of a household, the combined balances of the accounts in those account packages could provide each household member with certain additional benefits. \nIf you reside in a household where two or more eligible members each have at least one account in a separate \neligible Citibank account package, and you linked those eligible account packages together, we could make the features and benefits of our relationship pricing structure available to those household members. In most cases, eligible accounts belonging to all household members could be counted towards the combined household balance for purposes of determining whether monthly service fees and certain other account charges will be assessed and for determining eligibility for benefits associated with higher balance tiers or ranges. \nWe defined a “household” as an account owner and members of the account owner’s immediate family who \nresided at the same address. When asking us to link account packages you agree that your request will comply with any limitations applicable to the account packages that you ask to be linked. Under federal regulations: \n•When any account package includes an account with one of our affiliates, immediate family members \nwho\nse accounts can contribute pricing benefits are limited to the account owner and spouse; the \naccount owner’s parents, step-parents, siblings, step-brothers, step-sisters, children, step-children, grandchildren and their spouses. \n•When any account package includes a retirement account, that package can only contribute to pricing ben\nefits for the retirement account owner and spouse; the retirement account owner’s parents and \ngrandparents, and the retirement account owner’s children, siblings and their spouses. \nImportant: When household members’ account packages are linked for combined balances, statements \nfor each linked account package may show the household combined balance range. As a result, household members may be able to deduce approximate balances of other members in the household when account packages are linked. Therefore, when deciding whether to link household account packages, customers should evaluate their privacy needs within the household, along with their need for the rate and fee advantages. \nDiscontinued Products, Services, and Features   | 48']","The benefits of household linking of account packages for eligible Citibank account holders include the ability to combine balances of accounts in linked packages, which can provide each household member with additional benefits.

10,What are some fraud prevention tips for wire transfers?,"['T o cancel a Consumer International Wire Transfer, please call 1-888-606-9716 (TTY: We accept 711 or other \nRelay Service) and for Citibank Online initiated wire transfers, you can cancel online. When cancelling by phone, you will need to provide us with information to help identify the funds transfer you wish to cancel, including the amount and location where the funds were to be sent. Any refund will be made no later than three business days of your request to cancel.\nApplicable to all other Funds Transfer Requests\nYou may cancel or amend a funds transfer request (including a consumer international transfer not cancelled or amended in accordance with the special rules described in the section above) only if we receive your request prior to the execution of the funds transfer request and at a time that provides us with a reasonable opportunity to act upon that request. If your funds transfer request has already been executed by Citibank, you understand and agree that the request to cancel or amend the funds transfer will be effective with the voluntary consent of Citibank and the beneficiary bank. Citibank will first have to check with the beneficiary bank to determine whether or not the beneficiary bank will return your funds. If the beneficiary bank confirms that the funds are returnable and the funds are returned to Citibank, Citibank will return the funds to you. The amount that is returned to you may be less than you originally transferred because of service charges of the beneficiary bank and/or Citibank. Your returned funds will be in U.S. dollars. If your funds transfer was in foreign currency, your returned funds will be in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate established by Citibank on the date of return. Citibank shall not be liable to you for any loss resulting from the failure of the beneficiary bank to accept a cancellation or amendment of your funds transfer request. \nPlease Note: If your transfer is returned by the beneficiary bank to Citibank, an amendment request \ncannot be accepted and as a result, the funds will automatically be credited back to your account less any applicable service charges. If your transfer was in foreign currency, your returned funds will be in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate established by Citibank on the date of return as indicated above.\nRejection of a Funds Transfer Request\nWe reserve the right to reject your funds transfer request without cause or prior notice. We may reject your request if the dollar value of one or more of your transfer requests exceed your daily transfer limit, if you have insufficient available funds in your account for the amount of the funds transfer and applicable fee, if the information you provide in connection with that transfer is incomplete or unclear, if we are unable to confirm the identity or authority of the person providing the request, or if we are unable to fulfill your request for any other reason. For international transfers you understand we are required by U.S. regulations to provide you with certain information about your transfer request and if we are unable to provide you with that information at the time of your transfer request for any reason, we will need to reject your request. If we reject a request for a funds transfer, you will be notified of the rejection at the time of your request or as soon thereafter as we determine to reject the transfer request.\nGeneral Tips for Wire Transfer Safety\nWire transfers are a fast way to send money to individuals and businesses. However, because they are fast and final they can also be a target for fraud. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the incidents of wire transfer scams have increased significantly. Common scams include: phishing (attempts to obtain sensitive information such as account details by posing as a reputable company via email, text, or phone); family emergency (receipt of a message from a friend or family member claiming to be in need of money for an emergency); and IRS Impostors (fake IRS tax notices or individuals impersonating as IRS agents claiming you owe taxes).

Federal law allows banks to replace original checks with “substitute checks. ” Under the law, a substitute check is the “legal equivalent” of the original check. In other words, it can be used in the same way and for all purposes for which you would use the original check.\nYour Rights\nThe following rights apply if you receive a substitute check from us in lieu of the original check. These rights do not apply to original checks or to electronic debits. Your rights as to those transactions remain unchanged and are described in other sections of this Agreement. Please note these rights also do not apply to images of checks furnished to you or viewed through Citibank® Online.\nIn certain cases, federal law provides a special procedure that allows you to request a refund for losses you \nincur if you believe a substitute check is incorrectly posted to your account (for example, if you think your account was debited for the wrong amount) and production of the original check is needed to determine the validity of the debit. The losses you may attempt to recover may include the amount that was withdrawn from your account and fees that were charged as a result of the withdrawal (for example, overdraft check fees.) The amount of the refund you may request under this procedure is limited to the amount of your loss or the amount of the substitute check, whichever is less. You are also entitled to interest if your account is an interest-bearing account. If your loss exceeds the amount of the substitute check, you may be able to recover additional amounts under other laws.\nUnder federal law, you may receive up to $2,500 of your refund (plus interest if you have an interest-bearing \naccount) within ten (10) Business Days after we receive a complete claim from you and the remainder of your refund not later than forty-five (45) calendar days after we receive a complete claim from you. You will not be entitled to a refund if we determine that the substitute check was correctly posted to your account.

When cancelling by phone, you will need to provide us with information to help identify the funds transfer you wish to cancel, including the amount and location where the funds were to be sent. Any refund will be made no later than three business days of your request to cancel.\nApplicable to all other Funds Transfer Requests\nYou may cancel or amend a funds transfer request (including a consumer international transfer not cancelled or amended in accordance with the special rules described in the section above) only if we receive your request prior to the execution of the funds transfer request and at a time that provides us with a reasonable opportunity to act upon that request. If your funds transfer request has already been executed by Citibank, you understand and agree that the request to cancel or amend the funds transfer will be effective with the voluntary consent of Citibank and the beneficiary bank. Citibank will first have to check with the beneficiary bank to determine whether or not the beneficiary bank will return your funds. If the beneficiary bank confirms that the funds are returnable and the funds are returned to Citibank, Citibank will return the funds to you. The amount that is returned to you may be less than you originally transferred because of service charges of the beneficiary bank and/or Citibank. Your returned funds will be in U.S. dollars. If your funds transfer was in foreign currency, your returned funds will be in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate established by Citibank on the date of return. Citibank shall not be liable to you for any loss resulting from the failure of the beneficiary bank to accept a cancellation or amendment of your funds transfer request. \nPlease Note: If your transfer is returned by the beneficiary bank to Citibank, an amendment request \ncannot be accepted and as a result, the funds will automatically be credited back to your account less any applicable service charges. If your transfer was in foreign currency, your returned funds will be in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate established by Citibank on the date of return as indicated above.\nRejection of a Funds Transfer Request\nWe reserve the right to reject your funds transfer request without cause or prior notice. We may reject your request if the dollar value of one or more of your transfer requests exceed your daily transfer limit, if you have insufficient available funds in your account for the amount of the funds transfer and applicable fee, if the information you provide in connection with that transfer is incomplete or unclear, if we are unable to confirm the identity or authority of the person providing the request, or if we are unable to fulfill your request for any other reason. For international transfers you understand we are required by U.S. regulations to provide you with certain information about your transfer request and if we are unable to provide you with that information at the time of your transfer request for any reason, we will need to reject your request. If we reject a request for a funds transfer, you will be notified of the rejection at the time of your request or as soon thereafter as we determine to reject the transfer request.\nGeneral Tips for Wire Transfer Safety\nWire transfers are a fast way to send money to individuals and businesses. However, because they are fast and final they can also be a target for fraud. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the incidents of wire transfer scams have increased significantly. Common scams include: phishing (attempts to obtain sensitive information such as account details by posing as a reputable company via email, text, or phone); family emergency (receipt of a message from a friend or family member claiming to be in need of money for an emergency); and IRS Impostors (fake IRS tax notices or individuals impersonating as IRS agents claiming you owe taxes).

Step Up CDs automatically renew without the step up feature to a 30 month CD. You cannot renew an existing CD to a new Step Up CD. A Step Up CD is only available for new Step Up CD accounts. If you want to change your existing CD to a Step Up CD, you must first close your existing CD and then open a new Step Up CD.

We may offer promotions, from time to time, which may require a different account opening balance. No additional deposits are permitted during the term. A CD account will automatically be closed after 20 consecutive calendar days with a zero balance. Citi reserves the right to close the CD if the balance falls below any applicable minimum balance requirement. We will notify you that we closed your account if required by law. \nMonthly Service Fee \nThere is no monthly service fee for a Certificate of Deposit.\nLinking of CD accounts in an account package \nThe balances in other Citibank accounts that are linked to the account will not be included in the balance calculation for rate determination of your Certificate of Deposit account.

Currently, the currency conversion rate used to determine the transaction amount in U.S. dollars is based on either (1) a wholesale market rate or (2) a government-mandated rate in effect one day prior to the processing date. Transaction types currently processed by Citibank include ATM withdrawals made at many Proprietary Citibank ATMs outside the United States or Puerto Rico.\n• Transactions processed by MasterCard® currently use a conversion rate that is either: (a) selected from a range of rates available in the wholesale currency markets on the processing date (Note: this rate may be different from the rate that MasterCard® receives), or (b) the government-mandated rate. Transaction types currently processed by MasterCard® include Signature-based POS transactions and ATM withdrawals (including those at certain Proprietary Citibank ATMs). Please note that PIN-based POS transactions cannot be made at international locations.

The Step Up CD has 3 fixed interest rates for each period during the term beginning with Months 1 through 10, Months 11 through 20, and Months 21 through 30. Step Up CDs automatically renew without the step up feature to a 30 month CD. You cannot renew an existing CD to a new Step Up CD. A Step Up CD is only available for new Step Up CD accounts. If you want to change your existing CD to a Step Up CD, you must first close your existing CD and then open a new Step Up CD. You can renew a Step Up CD into any of the CD term options listed above.\nMinimum Balance The minimum balance required to open a Certificate of Deposit account is $500. We may offer promotions, from time to time, which may require a different account opening balance. No additional deposits are permitted during the term. A CD account will automatically be closed after 20 consecutive calendar days with a zero balance. Citi reserves the right to close the CD if the balance falls below any applicable minimum balance requirement. We will notify you that we closed your account if required by law. \nMonthly Service Fee \nThere is no monthly service fee for a Certificate of Deposit.\nLinking of CD accounts in an account package \nThe balances in other Citibank accounts that are linked to the account will not be included in the balance calculation for rate determination of your Certificate of Deposit account. The balances in your Certificate of Deposit account may contribute to the balances of eligible Citibank account packages for the purposes of package fee determination. \nCheck Writing \nCertificates of Deposit do not offer check writing.\nAPYs and Interest Rates \nAnnual Percentage Yield (APY) as used in this document is a percentage rate reflecting the total amount of interest paid on an account, based on the interest rate compounded daily for a period of one year assuming no fees, additional deposits or withdrawals, and the interest rate remains the same for the entire year. “Interest Rate” is the annual interest paid represented as a percentage assuming no change in rate and does not reflect compounding. \nAnnual Percentage Yields and interest rates for CDs are determined by Citibank at its sole discretion and can \nchange at any time without notice before a term begins for a new account and renewal. Interest rates are fixed for the CD term. The APY for a Step Up CD is a Composite APY based on 3 fixed interest rates during the term for Months 1 through 10, Months 11 through 20, and Months 21 through 30. The APY on your CD assumes interest will remain on deposit in the CD account until maturity. A withdrawal will reduce earnings. For current APYs and interest rates, please visit citi.com or the Citi Mobile App, call CitiPhone Banking® or stop by your nearest Citibank branch. \nFor a new CD, the APY and interest rate is based on the CD type, CD term, account balance, and applicable \npromotion at account opening. For new CD accounts with a Special Title (Trust, Estate, Representative Payee, Guardian/Conservator), the APY and interest rate will be the rate reflected on your applicable Rate Sheet provided at the time your account application was submitted. For a renewing CD, the APY and interest rate will be the APY and interest rate in effect on the CD renewal date for the CD term and account balance. When the APY is based on account balance, the applicable balance range at account opening or renewal will be used to determine your APY and interest rate and the interest rate will be fixed for the term; account balance may not be a factor for all CD terms.

Interest is computed using a 365-day year except in leap years when interest may be computed on a 366-day basis.\nAll CDs are available with the monthly interest feature. CD terms of one year or less also are available with \nthe interest at maturity feature. The No Penalty CD is only available with the monthly interest feature. Selecting the interest payment frequency can only be done when you open or renew your CD and not during the CD term. When you select the interest at maturity feature, the interest is credited on the Maturity Date and the interest payment frequency may be described as “Deferred” next to the CD term on your Account Statements and other notices. When you select the monthly interest feature, interest is credited to your account after the close of business on the last Business Day of each month, and on the Maturity Date. Interest is paid up to but not including the Maturity Date.\nIf you open your CD or your CD renews during the last week of any month, interest from the new CD opening \ndate or CD renewal date to the end of the month may be included with the interest for the first full month after the CD is opened or renewed. If you open your CD on the last day of a month with 30 days, and funding is credited on the first week of the next month, the interest for the day the account was opened may be credited on the day the CD was funded and the interest for the first full month may then be included in the next month’s interest payment. If the end of the month occurs during the Grace Period, interest accrued during the Grace Period will be included in the next month’s interest for renewed CDs. If the CD account is closed before maturity, the interest minus any applicable early withdrawal penalty will be reflected in the closeout balance.\nInterest Calculation Method \nWe use the daily balance method to calculate interest.

If your funds transfer request has already been executed by Citibank, you understand and agree that the request to cancel or amend the funds transfer will be effective with the voluntary consent of Citibank and the beneficiary bank.

37,"What could cause backup withholding on an account, especially regarding tax cert. and closure?","['Important Tax Information3\nWhen you apply to open an account, Citibank is required to obtain U.S. tax certification from each \naccount owner. If U.S. tax certification is not provided, the account will be subject to backup withholding. An account must not be subject to backup withholding to be eligible to participate in most account promotions; please refer to the separate promotion terms and conditions, if applicable.\nU.S. persons are required to furnish or have a valid Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification \nNumber and Certification) on file with Citibank. Foreign individuals are required to furnish or have a valid Form W-8BEN (Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals) on file with Citibank, and foreign entities are required to furnish or have a valid Form W-8BEN-E (Certificate of Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Entities) on file with Citibank.\nCitibank will apply backup withholding to income payments (e.g., interest) if you: (a) fail to provide a \ncorrect Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), or (b) the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notifies us that you furnished an incorrect TIN, or (c) you or we are notified by the IRS that you are subject to backup withholding. Additionally, the IRS may charge you a $50 penalty for failing to provide Citibank with your correct Name/TIN combination. In some cases, a state and local tax authority may also require that we apply state and local backup withholding on income paid to your account when we are required to apply Federal backup withholding.\nInterest received by U.S Persons will be reported on IRS Form 1099-INT for the year received, as required by \napplicable law. Interest paid to non-U.S. Persons will be reported on IRS Form 1042-S for the year received. If 1099 reporting is required, Citibank will issue a 1099 to the first titled owner on the account. For jointly owned accounts that include both a U.S. owner and a foreign owner, we will issue the 1099 to the U.S. owner.\nPlease review the separate IRA and other tax-qualified retirement account disclosures for additional \nrequirements that may apply.\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act\nIn order for Citibank to be compliant with the provisions of The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (commonly known as “FATCA”), a U.S. federal tax law, Citibank may contact you to request additional information and/or documentation. Please understand that Citibank does not and will not in any way support any attempt by you to evade U.S. taxes or any request by you for help in avoiding detection under FATCA. Furthermore, since Citibank is not in the business of providing tax advice, you should not rely upon Citibank to determine the impact of FATCA on your own business activities or what your own compliance obligations are under FATCA. We encourage you to seek the advice of experienced tax advisors to determine what actions you need to take to become FATCA compliant. Your failure to comply with FATCA may result in restricted access or withholding of taxes from interest payments due to you.\nFootnotes:\n3 IRS Circular 230 Disclosure: Citibank, N.A. its affiliates, and its employees are not in the business of \nproviding tax or legal advice to any taxpayer outside of Citibank, N.A. and its affiliates.
